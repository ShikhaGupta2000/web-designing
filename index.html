We offer intineraries for first-time visitors as well as tourists who already<b style="color:blue;" ><u> France </u></b>and<b style="color:blue;"> <u>Paris</u> </b>very well.
We give you to chance to discover the Eiffel Tower quarter and its traits, as well as the less tourist Bastille, and Art Nouveau in the gare Saint-Lazare district and even the little-known Buttes Chaumont. We also visit Montmartre and les Puces de St Ouen.
We offer exlcusive deals with partners including unique workshops about our local knowledge and how to live like the French, e.g. a painting course on the earthenware of Gien.

We have also created an activitity dedicated to a top-quality experinence in partnership with French brands with four different themes: gastronomy, beauty, fashion and arts and sophisication. We hold tasting sessions, shopping trips and well-being sessions, available on www.myworkshopinparis.com. We are at the heart of promoting<u> French</u> local knowledge as well as the art of living that makes this country so special.
